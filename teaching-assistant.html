								<header><h2>Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for Discrete Math</h2></header>
								
								<p>This is my second semester working as an undergraduate teaching assistant
								for Georgia Tech's College of Computing. I hold virtual office hours for 3 hours
								a week, answer about 10 student's questions a day on an online forum, grade 20-25
								students homework's a week, attend lecture and answer students questions in a live chat,
								and occasionally record recitation videos to be viewed by all of the almost 500 students
								in the course. I also attend weekly meetings and communicate frequently with the head
								TA and professors. </p>

								<p>When we return to in-person classes, I will assume more responsibilities, including
								holding weekly recitations for about 30 students, helping to create, proctor, and grade
								exams, and helping teach lecture in the absence of the professor. </p>
