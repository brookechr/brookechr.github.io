									<p>I worked on this project over the span of 6 weeks during my remote internship
									at Computer Enterprises, Inc. (CEI) during the summer of 2020. The aim of the project
									was to create a website that would allow employees at CEI to search a registry of other
									employees by their skills, certifications, industries of expertise, location, and
									employment type. Employees would be able to both create their own profile and browse
									others’ profiles. </p>

									<p>For the first half, I worked alongside an intern with a digital design background.
									We used Figma to create low-fidelity, mid-fidelity, and high-fidelity prototypes.
									Our boss was our stakeholder for the project, so we worked under him and a senior
									UX designer, though for most of the time, it was just me and the other intern. The
									project evolved a lot between having to scrap a bunch of screens when we realized
									they wouldn’t fit in the MVP and switching the component library midway through. </p>
										
									<p>Once we had completed the designs for the project, it was time to start developing.
									While the digital design intern moved onto another project, I was joined by another
									software engineering intern to work on the code. I did a lot of the front-end coding,
									using Angular with Angular Material and SCSS. Though the project wasn’t completed by
									the time I left, I learned so much. It was my first time really using version control
									software or working on any software project for so long, and I had never even heard of
									Angular or TypeScript when I started. </p>
										
									<p>
									The following is a quote from the senior UX designer I worked with:
									
									<em>“Her attention to detail was remarkable and her efficiency in doing both design and
									development were on par with some of the very best I have had the pleasure of working
									with over my career.
											
									Needless to say, I fully recommend and endorse Brooke to absolutely anyone in the software
									development industry. She is going to have an incredible career, one that I believe will
									be transformative to any company that is lucky enough to hire her.”</em>
									</p>
